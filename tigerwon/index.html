<h1>Employee vs. Entrepreneur: Which Career Path Is The Right One For You? (Food and Beverage Edition)</h1><h1>Many people ask themselves about their career – should they remain an employee of a company or branch away to start their own business?</h1><p> I had a chance to speak with a merchandiser who was employed with Whole Foods for more than 12 years. He knows the team members and ATL at all NYC Whole Foods stores. He led an ATL in a prime part of NYC. (If you don’t know, ATL works alongside managers and knows the best food and beverage product spots. They can position and bring awareness about your products to potential customers.)</p><p> He seemed happy with his position, but he really wasn’t. He felt unsatisfied. This ambitious young Latino man felt he deserved to earn more being a merchandiser – felt he was worth more than what his employer was actually paying him. He brought up the idea of starting his own merchandising company. After all, he’d already established strong relationships and knew what it took for food and beverage products to stand out on store shelves. After hearing the story, there were so many things I wanted to ask him.</p><p><strong>Six Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before You Leap Into Business Ownership</strong></p><p>I came up with six questions to ask him to determine if he was ready to become a business owner (and, you can use these questions to your particularly situation).</p><ul><li>How much do you think a merchandiser in NYC should make?</li><li>What kind of job description would you write for the salary you’d get?</li><li>Would you be willing to work 50 or more hours as an entrepreneur – no days off, no vacation – for a minimum of two years to begin with?</li><li>Will you be able to hire the best folks to help you with the endeavor – merchandisers, sales rep, marketing gurus, etc.?</li><li>Will you be able to win contracts with food and beverage companies?</li><li>Who’s going to handle the business’ daily operation?</li></ul><p> He answered the first two questions, saying he thought $50,000 a year was fair. However, he couldn’t come up with a job description. This means he’ll need to do a little bit of research into the amount of money he thinks he’s worth for handling the areas of NYC and NJ. Is $50,000 enough money? Should he be earning more? These are questions he’ll need to answer before he begins his own business.</p><p>When it came to time spent on the business, he didn’t think he should work 40 hours without a vacation. And, when it came to hiring the best folks for his company, he said he’d get folks from Whole Foods. He didn’t, however, think about the sales rep position as well as the operational person to run the business with him.</p><p> Are you facing the same kind of problem as this ambitious young man? Are you questioning your decisions? If so, then here’s my take for your predicament:</p><p> Continue working for your employer – just for a short time and have about two years’ worth of income saved. You can spend this time learning about the problems your direct competitor is faced with. It’s possible to solve the company’s issue while you work on building your own company. Plus, you can save money as you put together your business plan.</p><p> When you’re ready, then take the leap into being an entrepreneur. You’ll be better prepared and have a higher chance of succeeding.</p><picture>

<h1>Are you Hiring the Right Brand Ambassador?</h1><h2>New products are introduced into the market all the time. Tech, food and beverage, clothing lines…you name it, new products are entering. What is crucial for your business is to have the right brand ambassadors to know about your products/services and to advocate for them.</h2><h1> Tips on hiring your brand ambassador: 1) Brand ambassadors should genuinely love your product or service. That person should have at least tested out your product/service before they meet you. If you’re selling clothes, they should have worn your clothing line. 2) The best brand ambassador should also be able to connect with customers and also bring feedback to the CEO on what the next upcoming flavor or an update included to improve the product/service. If your customers really want to see new spring colors, your brand ambassador must be able to tell you. 3) Your brand ambassador is well connected in communities both online and offline. This is not only a way for your brand ambassador to get the word out, but also a way for the customers to communicate their wants and needs back to your company. 4) Pay fairly and on Time! Brand ambassadors have different rates. If you’re paying for $10/hour, don't expect that the person will work full time to advocate and grow your brand for you. You get what you paid for. For NYC the rate is $15-60/hour depending on the size of the work and responsibilities. Most startup companies forget to pay their employees which is a big NO NO!! 5) Find brand ambassadors that are able to grow with your company. As your company is growing rapidly you want to keep the people who are passionate, dedicated, skillful and love your company. This means the brand ambassadors that can not only promote you, but are also able to grow within your company and be your sales rep. My suggestion:Start looking for bloggers, vloggers or content creators that love your products and know how to advocate for you. Interview them and see if they are a good fit to your company's mission.</h1></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="46"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="48"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="49"><span data-reactid="50"><!-- react-empty: 51 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="52"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="53">TIGERWON</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="56"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

That person should have at least tested out your product/service before they meet you. If you’re selling clothes, they should have worn your clothing line. 2) The best brand ambassador should also be able to connect with customers and also bring feedback to the CEO on what the next upcoming flavor or an update included to improve the product/service. If your customers really want to see new spring colors, your brand ambassador must be able to tell you. 3) Your brand ambassador is well connected in communities both online and offline. This is not only a way for your brand ambassador to get the word out, but also a way for the customers to communicate their wants and needs back to your company. 4) Pay fairly and on Time! Brand ambassadors have different rates. If you’re paying for $10/hour, don't expect that the person will work full time to advocate and grow your brand for you. You get what you paid for. For NYC the rate is $15-60/hour depending on the size of the work and responsibilities. Most startup companies forget to pay their employees which is a big NO NO!! 5) Find brand ambassadors that are able to grow with your company. As your company is growing rapidly you want to keep the people who are passionate, dedicated, skillful and love your company. This means the brand ambassadors that can not only promote you, but are also able to grow within your company and be your sales rep. My suggestion:Start looking for bloggers, vloggers or content creators that love your products and know how to advocate for you. Interview them and see if they are a good fit to your company's mission.","_html":"<h1> Tips on hiring your brand ambassador: 1) Brand ambassadors should genuinely love your product or service.
